        <p> Stuck on which podcast to choose?
            Take a trip to the Podcast Roulette, and let me choose for you.
            Fear not, for I am stocked with a generous supply
            of JRE episodes. In fact, I'm pretty sure my program
            is just a fancy JRE and lex episode generator at this point.
            Who knows, you might just discover your new favorite show.
            Or, you know, just keep listening to JRE and lex on repeat.
            I won't judge.
